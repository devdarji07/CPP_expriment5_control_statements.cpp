# ⚙️ C++ Experiment 5: Decision Making Statements – `if`, `nested if`, and `switch-case`

## 🎯 Aim
- To write C++ programs using `if-else` and `nested if` statements.
- To use `switch-case` for handling multiple conditions efficiently.

---

## 📌 Objectives
✔️ Understand how to use `if`, `else`, and `nested if` in real-life problems.  
✔️ Use `switch-case` for multi-condition selection.  
✔️ Learn to use `break` and `exit(0)` for better program control.

## 🧠 Theory

### 🔹 If-Else Statement
Used when a condition results in one of two possible outcomes.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code runs if condition is true
} else {
    // Code runs if condition is false
}
```
```cpp
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block
        break;
    default:
        // Code block if no case matches
}
```
✅ Conclusion
This experiment helped us understand how to make decisions in C++ using if, nested if, and switch-case. These control structures are essential for writing interactive programs that respond to different conditions. We also practiced using break to stop case execution and exit(0) to terminate a program early if needed.
